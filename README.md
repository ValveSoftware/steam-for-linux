Steam for Linux Issue Tracker
-----------------------------

This is the issue tracker for the Steam for Linux beta client.

Reporting issues
----------------

If you encounter an issue while using Steam for Linux or with any of the available Linux games, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue; and
- your system information.\*

Please place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

\* The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`About -> Hardware Information`). Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`. Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block.
